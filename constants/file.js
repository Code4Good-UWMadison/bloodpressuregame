"4 (Cortisol) One of the effects cortisol has on the body is to increase blood pressure by supporting the sympathetic nervous system response. "," 6 (Stimulate fasciculata) The zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex secretes cortisol. "," 9 (Stimulate vasomotor center) The vasomotor center is involved in the baroreceptor reflex to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure falls, baroreceptors on the aorta are not stretched as much, so their firing to the cardioacceleratory and vasomotor centers in the brain decrease. Baroreceptors fire inhibitory postsynaptic potentials on the cardioinhibitory and vasomotor centers, therefore a decrease in that inhibitory input would increase their activity. The vasomotor center causes vasoconstriction, thus regulating total peripheral resistance, and is involved in sympathetic nervous system responses. "," 10 (Stimulate cardioacceleratory center) The cardioacceleratory center is involved in the baroreceptor reflex to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure falls, baroreceptors on the aorta are not stretched as much, so their firing to the cardioacceleratory and vasomotor centers in the brain decrease. Baroreceptors fire inhibitory postsynaptic potentials on the cardioinhibitory and vasomotor centers, therefore a decrease in that inhibitory input would increase their activity. The cardioacceleratory center causes an increase in heart rate and contractility, and it is involved in sympathetic nervous system responses. "," 11 (Stimulate glomerulosa) The zona glomerulosa secretes the hormone aldosterone which increases sodium reabsorption by the kidneys. Water tends to follow sodium through osmosis to maintain osmolarity. "," 12 (Vasopressin) Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) works in two ways to increase blood pressure. It constricts arterioles causing an increase in BP as well as inducing the insertion of aquaporin channels in the collecting duct cells of the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of water. This increase in blood volume causes a rise in blood pressure. "," 14 (Epinephrine - pharmacological dosage) Epinephrine has a higher affinity for beta-2 receptors, which dilate arterioles, but at a pharmacological dosage, there is enough epinephrine that binds to alpha-1 receptors (which cause vasoconstriction) for the sympathetic response of alpha-1s to outweigh the parasympathetic response of the beta-2s, due to the sheer quantity of alpha-1 receptors compared to beta-2s. "," 16 (Beta-2 receptor antagonist) Beta-2 receptors cause arterioles to dilate, so blocking them with an antagonist would prevent local factors from binding. "," 18 (Promote salt intake) An increase in sodium in the blood will increase the osmolarity, causing more water to be reabsorbed from the kidneys in order to restore a homeostatic osmolarity. The increase in blood volume raises blood pressure. "," 20 (Alpha-1 receptor agonist) Alpha-1 receptors are located on the blood vessels, and when activated cause an increase in vasoconstriction, which results in a higher blood pressure. "," 21 (Promote rehydration) An increase in water will increase blood volume, in turn raising blood pressure. "," 22 (Angiotensin II) Angiotensin II is a hormone that raises blood pressure in 2 ways. First, it acts on the cardiovascular system, causing vasoconstriction. Second, it increases the secretion of aldosterone, in turn promoting sodium reabsorption which increases water reabsorption. The increase in blood volume plus vasoconstriction results in a higher blood pressure. "," 24 (Norepinephrine) Norepinephrine is a neurohormone that is released by sympathetic varicosities. It has a higher affinity for alpha-1 receptors, which are located in arterioles. Alpha-1 receptors cause vasoconstriction which increases blood pressure. "," 29 (Stimulate adrenal medulla) The adrenal medulla secretes primarily epinephrine and a small amount of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine initiates the “fight-or-flight” sympathetic response while epinephrine supports it. The sympathetic response raises blood pressure."," 31 (Beta-1 receptor agonist) Beta-1 receptors are located on the SA node and cardiac muscle cells and respond to norepinephrine and epinephrine. These speed up the heart and increase the contractility of the ventricles, increasing cardiac output and thus increasing arterial blood pressure."," 32 (Muscarinic-Ach receptor antagonist) Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are the postganglionic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system. In the cardiovascular system, they are located on the SA node, and when stimulated they hyperpolarize the membrane of the SA node, reducing the pacemaker potential and slowing the heart rate. Although heart rate is not directly related to blood pressure, a slower heart rate due to parasympathetic input will not aid in raising blood pressure, therefore a muscarinic-Ach receptor antagonist will take that inhibition away. "," 34 (Guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) Guanylyl cyclase is an enzyme that is activated by nitric oxide. Guanylyl cyclase produces cyclic GMP (cGMP) which activates protein kinase G to phosphorylate proteins that open potassium channels. This hyperpolarizes the membrane, releasing the contraction in arterioles, thus dilating them and lowering blood pressure. Therefore, a substance that inhibits guanylyl cyclase would prevent that from happening, thus maintaining smooth muscle contraction and higher blood pressure. "," 35 (cGMP breakdown) As described in 34, cGMP is part of the second messenger pathway that leads to vasodilation. Decreasing the amount of cGMP by breaking it down would prevent that and help in achieving a higher blood pressure. "," 37 (Increase cytosolic calcium) Increasing the calcium in the cytosol of a cardiac muscle cell means that there is more calcium available to bind to troponin to allow actin and myosin to bind and cross bridge cycling to occur. This strengthens the contractions of the heart, meaning it pumps harder. This increases the blood pressure by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. "," 39 (cAMP production) cAMP is part of the second messenger pathway when epinephrine and norepinephrine binds to beta-1 receptors on the heart. The receptor activates adenylyl cyclase which produces cAMP, activating protein kinase A (PKA) that increases cytosolic calcium from both the interstitial fluid and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This extra calcium, as described in 37, increases contraction force and speed. This increases blood pressure by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. "," 41 (PKA activation) Protein kinase A, as described in 39, is part of the second messenger pathway that responds to sympathetic input by increasing heart rate and contractility, which increases blood pressure. "," 43 (Increase MABP) A blood pressure of 76/43 is too low so blood pressure needs to increase. "," 44 (Increase TPR) Total peripheral resistance refers to the level of resistance blood encounters while flowing through vessels. Resistance is inversely related to radius, to a power of 4. Therefore an increase in TPR indicates vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure. "," 47 (Increase stroke volume) Stroke volume is a measure of the difference in the volume of blood in the left ventricle between systole and diastole. Stroke volume can be influenced by the contractility of the heart, meaning a harder contraction results in a higher stroke volume. This increases the amount of blood entering the aorta each beat, increasing arterial pressure. "," 50 (Increase cardiac output) Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. A higher cardiac output indicates more blood being pumped into the aorta faster, increasing arterial blood pressure. "," 53 (Increase venous return) An increase in venous return can be induced by sympathetic stimulation of alpha-1 receptors. The increase in blood back toward the heart can increase blood pressure through increased stroke volume. "," 54 (Increase contractility) Increasing the force of contraction in cardiac muscle cells means that more blood will be pumped out per beat, increasing stroke volume and blood pressure. "," 57 (increase ejection fraction) An increase in ejection fraction would allow more blood to be ejected during systole. This would increase the amount of blood in circulation, and would therefore increase the overall blood pressure."

"3 (Limit fluids) Limiting fluids will help particularly in this patient’s case because the reason their blood pressure is so high is that their kidneys are malfunctioning and reabsorbing too much water. Limiting fluids will prevent the problem from worsening and help in achieving a lower blood pressure. "," 7 (Histamine) Histamine is a vasodilator, and therefore lowers blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance (TPR). "," 8 (Nitroglycerine) Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator, working through activating guanylyl cyclase, increasing cGMP. This relaxes the smooth muscle of blood vessels by opening potassium channels and hyperpolarizing the membrane. "," 15 (Nitric oxide) Nitric oxide is a product of the breakdown of nitroglycerin, therefore dilating blood vessels through the cGMP-protein kinase G second messenger pathway. "," 17 (Limit salt intake) Because water gets reabsorbed along with salt, which would increase blood pressure. "," 23 (ACE inhibitors) ACE increases concentration of active angiotensin II by converting it from its inactive form angiotensin I, which increases sodium and water retention, which raises blood pressure. ACE inhibitors thereby will lower blood pressure. "," 25 (Muscarinic-AchR agonist) Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are the postganglionic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system. In the cardiovascular system, they are located on the SA node, and when stimulated they hyperpolarize the membrane of the SA node, reducing the pacemaker potential and slowing the heart rate. Although heart rate is not directly related to blood pressure, a slower heart rate due to parasympathetic input will put less strain on the heart and will play a role in reducing blood pressure. "," 26 (Alpha 1 receptor antagonist) Alpha 1 receptors are on the blood vessels and bind most strongly with norepinephrine. When norepinephrine binds, the blood vessels constrict, and blood pressure increases. An alpha 1 receptor antagonist will inhibit this process, and thereby reduce blood pressure. "," 27 (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)) ANP is produced in the atria and acts as an “anti-aldosterone”. When ANP is secreted, it decreases plasma aldosterone through decreasing renin production, which decreases sodium retention (and water retention since water follows salt), thereby lowering blood pressure. "," 28 (Beta 2 receptor agonist) Beta 2 receptors are on the blood vessels and has the greatest binding affinity for epinephrine. When epinephrine binds, the vessels dilate, which increases surface area and thereby reduces blood pressure. A beta 2 receptor agonist will have this effect by activating those receptors.

"," 42 (PKA inhibition) Protein kinase A, as described in 40, is part of the second messenger pathway that responds to sympathetic input by increasing heart rate and contractility, which increases blood pressure. Inhibiting PKA will block this process, reducing blood pressure. "," 45 (Decrease MABP) Since this patient’s blood pressure is too high, the goal is to lower it overall. "," 46 (Decrease TPR) Total peripheral resistance refers to the level of resistance blood encounters while flowing through vessels. Resistance is inversely related to radius, to a power of 4. Therefore a decrease in TPR indicates vasodilation, decreasing blood pressure.

" 9 (Stimulate vasomotor center) The vasomotor center is involved in the baroreceptor reflex to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure falls, baroreceptors on the aorta are not stretched as much, so their firing to the cardioacceleratory and vasomotor centers in the brain decrease. Baroreceptors fire inhibitory postsynaptic potentials on the cardioinhibitory and vasomotor centers, therefore a decrease in that inhibitory input would increase their activity. The vasomotor center causes vasoconstriction, thus regulating total peripheral resistance, and is involved in sympathetic nervous system responses. Stimulating the vasomotor center directly will increase blood pressure for this reason."," 12 (vasopressin) also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), vasopressin is secreted from the posterior pituitary and increases blood pressure in 2 ways. It constricts arterioles, causing an increase in BP, and it induces the insertion of aquaporin channels in the collecting duct of the kidney, stimulating water reabsorption. Increasing water reabsorption will increase blood pressure."," 14 (epinephrine- pharmacological dosage) Epinephrine has a higher affinity for beta-2 receptors, which dilate arterioles, but at a pharmacological dosage, there is enough epinephrine that binds to alpha-1 receptors (which cause vasoconstriction) for the sympathetic response of alpha-1s to outweigh the parasympathetic response of the beta-2s, due to the sheer quantity of alpha-1 receptors compared to beta-2s."," 16 (beta 2 receptor antagonist) - when epinephrine binds to beta 2 receptors, it dilates the arterioles, thereby increasing surface area and decreasing blood pressure.

Although heart rate is not directly related to blood pressure, a slower heart rate due to parasympathetic input will not aid in raising blood pressure, therefore a muscarinic-Ach receptor antagonist will take that inhibition away."," 34 (Guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) Guanylyl cyclase is an enzyme that is activated by nitric oxide. Guanylyl cyclase produces cyclic GMP (cGMP) which activates protein kinase G to phosphorylate proteins that open potassium channels. This hyperpolarizes the membrane, releasing the contraction in arterioles, thus dilating them and lowering blood pressure. Therefore, a substance that inhibits guanylyl cyclase would prevent that from happening, thus maintaining smooth muscle contraction and higher blood pressure."," 35 (cGMP breakdown) as described in 34, cGMP is part of the second messenger pathway that leads to vasodilation.

Increasing the amount of cGMP will reduce blood pressure."," 38 (Decrease cytosolic calcium) Calcium in the cytosol of a cardiac muscle will bind to troponin to allow actin and myosin to bind and cross bridge cycling to occur. This strengthens the contractions of the heart, meaning it pumps harder. This increases the blood pressure by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. By decreasing cytosolic calcium, this process will decrease, thereby decreasing blood pressure."," 40 (cAMP breakdown) cAMP is part of the second messenger pathway when epinephrine and norepinephrine binds to beta-1 receptors on the heart. The receptor activates adenylyl cyclase which produces cAMP, activating protein kinase A (PKA) that increases cytosolic calcium from both the interstitial fluid and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This extra calcium, increases contraction force and speed, which increases blood pressure by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. Breaking down cAMP inhibits this cascade and the activation of PKA, thereby lowering blood pressure."," 42 (PKA inhibition) Protein kinase A, as described in 40, is part of the second messenger pathway that responds to sympathetic input by increasing heart rate and contractility, which increases blood pressure. Inhibiting PKA will block this process, reducing blood pressure."," 45 (Decrease MABP) Since this patient’s blood pressure is too high, the goal is to lower it overall."," 46 (Decrease TPR) Total peripheral resistance refers to the level of resistance blood encounters while flowing through vessels. Resistance is inversely related to radius, to a power of 4. Therefore a decrease in TPR indicates vasodilation, decreasing blood pressure."," 48 (Decrease stroke volume) Stroke volume is a measure of the difference in the volume of blood in the left ventricle between systole and diastole. Stroke volume can be influenced by the contractility of the heart, meaning a harder contraction results in a higher stroke volume. This increases the amount of blood entering the aorta each beat, increasing arterial pressure. Therefore, lowering stroke volume will lower blood pressure."," 49 (Decrease cardiac output) Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. A lower cardiac output indicates less blood being pumped into the aorta, decreasing arterial blood pressure."," 55 (Decrease contractility) Decreasing the force of contraction in cardiac muscle cells means that less blood will be pumped out per beat, decreasing stroke volume and blood pressure."," 56 (Decrease ejection fraction) Decreasing the ejection fraction would decrease the amount of blood ejected during systole, which would lower the amount of blood in circulation, and therefore decrease the overall blood pressure."
